3. LICENSE CONDITIONS AND VERIFICATION

Utilization of the UNICORN Binance WebSocket API demands authentication through a license key and an API secret from

Verification is achieved via a client-side module, which forwards the license details to our backend for validation.
Only those with a verified license operate as intended. This open-source procedure is integral to foster user trust,
especially traders.

For transparency, our licensing client module is available on GitHub:
